With Matlab properly configured for C++ mex compilation, run the following commands from the MyFM directory, in the Matlab console:

mex MyFM/FastMarchingEikonalMobilityNewton.cpp
mex MyFM/FastMarchingExtend.cpp

Then run shootingFM.m for an example of the shooting algorithm on the artificial data example stored in Random2.mat
